# Data

``display_signal.py`` can be used to easily see what data is inside of a file, it takes as an argument the path to a data file, then filters and displays the content. Run ``python display_signal.py "path_to_datafile"`` to see what the data looks like in a specific file

For example, try running the following 
```
python display_signal.py 2021-05-20/01-1_video_OpenBCI-RAW-2021-05-20_19-59-47.txt
```
Note: you can use tabs in your terminal to autocomplete long filenames.

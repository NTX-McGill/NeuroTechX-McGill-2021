This folder contains python scripts for various experiments and analysis 
E.g. plotting the spectrogram, bad trials. How to reject bad channels when building the template, etc. 
Some scripts are for offline analysis, not real-time inference.
This folder also has other variants of CCA methods, which is not used since it underperforms standard CCA.

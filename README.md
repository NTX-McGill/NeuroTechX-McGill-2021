## Data

We collected data from eleven university students, both male and female, with an 8-electrode set-up on the participant’s occipital lobe. The Oz, O1, O2, PO7, PO8, PO, PO3, and PO4 electrode positions of the 10/20 system were used for data collection (Figure 1). The electrodes were fixed in position with a headband using the nasion, inion, and the helices of the pinnae as landmarks. Noise was limited to 8 microvolts for each electrode by limiting movement of the participant and of others in the vicinity. Data collection conditions were controlled for each participant by using the same electrode placements, positioning the participants around 40 cm from the keyboard display on the screen, and using the same hardware and environment conditions.

The data collection interface cued the participant to look at a specific key on the keyboard by highlighting it red. All keys would then flash at their unique frequencies and phases for five seconds. Frequencies varied from 6.00–12.90 Hz incremented by 0.23 Hz while the phases started at 0 and increased by 0.35 pi radians. The data collected during the five seconds was then stored in the database and attributed to the cued key. This process iterated through each key on the keyboard, completing one block of data collection. We aimed to acquire 10—15 blocks of data per participant.
